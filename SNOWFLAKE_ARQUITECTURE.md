# Snowflake Architecture

## 5.1 Key components of Snowflake’s Cloud data platform
Snowflake is a cloud data platform that enables large-scale data storage and analysis.

### Data Types
Snowflake supports a variety of data types, such as numbers, strings, dates, variants, etc.

### Optimizer
Snowflake uses a cost-based optimizer to process queries in the most efficient way possible.

### Continuous data protection
Snowflake features data protection aspects such as replication across geographical regions and recovery of deleted or modified data.

### Cloning
Snowflake allows cloning of databases, schemas, or tables without duplicating the storage.

### Types of Caching
Snowflake utilizes several caching layers to improve query performance, including result cache and storage cache.

### Web Interface (UI)
Snowflake provides a web interface for the management and administration of the platform.

### Data Cloud/Data Sharing/Data Marketplace/Data Exchange
Snowflake enables secure, real-time data sharing and consumption through its Data Cloud, Marketplace, and Data Exchange.

## 5.2 Snowflake data sharing capabilities
Snowflake facilitates large-scale data sharing with a security-centered approach.

### Account types
Snowflake offers different account types to suit business needs.

### Data Marketplace & Exchange
Snowflake enables data sharing and consumption through its data Marketplace and Data Exchange features.

### Access Control options
Snowflake allows detailed management of access permissions to the data.

### Shares
Snowflake enables sharing of views and tables via Shares, facilitating collaboration and data exchange.

## 5.3 How Snowflake is different compared to legacy warehouse solutions
Snowflake is a modern, scalable solution that differs in several key aspects.

### Elastic Storage
Snowflake separates storage from compute, allowing each to scale independently.

### Elastic Compute
Snowflake enables compute capacity to scale up or down instantly, adjusting to workload demands.

### Account Management
Snowflake facilitates management of users, roles, and permissions to ensure data security.

## 5.4 Outline the different editions that are available, and the functionality associated with each edition
Snowflake offers several editions with different sets of features and pricing.

### Pricing
Snowflake editions vary in price based on included features and offered service levels.

### Features
Snowflake editions vary in functionality, enabling businesses to select the one that best fits their needs.

## 5.5 Identify Snowflake’s Partner Ecosystem
Snowflake has a robust partner ecosystem that extends its functionality and usage.

### Cloud Partners
Snowflake integrates with major cloud service providers, such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

### Connectors
Snowflake provides connectors for a wide range of data analysis tools and platforms.

## 5.6 Outline and define the purpose of Snowflake’s three distinct layers
Snowflake uses a three-layer architecture to separate storage, compute, and services.

### Storage Layer
The storage layer stores data in columnar format and handles all data management tasks.

### Compute Layer
The compute layer processes queries in isolation to ensure performance.

### Cloud Services Layer
The cloud services layer manages security, query optimization, transaction coordination, and metadata.

## 5.7 Outline Snowflake’s catalog and objects
Snowflake uses an object catalog to organize and manage data.

### Database
Data in Snowflake are stored in databases, which are logical containers for schemas.

### Schema
Schemas are containers for tables, views, and other objects.

### Tables Types
Snowflake supports several table types, including permanent, temporary, and transient tables.

### View Types
Snowflake supports standard and materialized views, which are virtual representations of table data.

### Data Types
Snowflake supports a wide variety of data types, including numbers, strings, dates, and variants.

### External Functions
Snowflake allows the creation of external functions that call out to external services to process data.
