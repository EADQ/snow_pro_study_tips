# COMPUTE LAYER TEST

## Credit Consumption by the Compute Layer <br>(Virtual Warehouses) is based on:
### Warehouse size
###  #of clusters for the Warehouse

## What is a virtual warehouse?
### A collection of compute resources that can <br>be used for queries, loading, etc.

## True: Scaling in is a manual process (e.g. Max Clusters to min clusters)

## Flase: Scaling down is a automated process. (e.g. X-Large to Large)

## What is true about scaling up?
### Used for more complex workload
####  Comments: Resizing a warehouse generally improves query <br>performance, particularly for larger, more complex queries

## True: Storage can increase or decrease without any effect on virtual warehouse sizes

## False: Scaling up is intended for handling concurrency issues due to more users or more queries

## What is the minimum duration charged when starting a virtual warehouse?
### 1 minute

## True: Scaling a Warehouse OUT will increase <br>the number of clusters (e.g., Min to Max)
### Comments: SCALING OUT means adding additional clusters. <br>It is called Multi-Clustering.

## When scaling up Virtual Warehouse by increasing <br>Virtual Warehouse t-shirt size, you are primarily scaling for improved:
### Performance

## False: Scaling up is intended for handling <br>concurrency issues due to more users or more queries
