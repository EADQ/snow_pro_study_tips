### Allows users to build applications that process data in Snowflake without moving data into the system where application code runs.
### Supported languages: Scala, Java, Python.


## SNOWPARK AND SNOWFLAKE
### Snowpark translates code into optimized SQL and pushes execution to
### owflake's elastic processing engine over JDBC
### Provides wrapper methods to run many of the standard Snowflake functions
### Includes the session.sql0 method so you can execute any arbitrary SQL statement
### Easily searchable API Reference Documentation catalogues objects, classes and functions

## NATIVE SNOWFLAKE DATAFRAMES
### The core abstraction in <br>Snowpark is the DataFrame
#### Optimized data structure conceptually like a table
#### Commonly used in programmatic paradigms for working with relational datasets
#### Includes methods (prebuilt routines or functions) to operate on its data.
